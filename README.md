# TravelTrucks Front‑End

This project is a simple React application built with Vite. It demonstrates a basic setup with React Router and Redux. The app contains placeholder pages for the TravelTrucks rental service.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

3. **Lint the code** (optional)

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Create a production build** (optional)

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Available Pages

- `/` – Home page with a call to action.
- `/catalog` – Catalog page listing campers (placeholder data).
- `/catalog/:id` – Details page for an individual camper.

These pages are minimal and serve as a starting point for further development.
